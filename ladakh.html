<h2>Ladakh</h2>
<p>Ladakh is the highest plateau in India with much of it being over 3,000 m (9,800 ft).
  It extends from the Himalayan to the Kunlun Ranges and includes the upper Indus River valley.</p>
      <p>
        Historically, the region included the Baltistan (Baltiyul) valleys (now mostly in Pakistani administered part of Kashmir), 
        the entire upper Indus Valley, the remote Zanskar, Lahaul and Spiti to the south, much of Ngari including the Rudok region and Guge in the east,
         Aksai Chin in the northeast, and the Nubra Valley to the north over Khardong La in the Ladakh Range. Contemporary Ladakh borders Tibet to the east, 
         the Lahaul and Spiti regions to the south, the Vale of Kashmir, Jammu and Baltiyul regions to the west, and the southwest corner of Xinjiang across
          the Karakoram Pass in the far north. The historic but imprecise divide between Ladakh and the Tibetan Plateau commences in the north in the intricate
           maze of ridges east of Rudok including Aling Kangri and Mavang Kangri, and continues southeastward toward northwestern Nepal. 
           Before partition, Baltistan, now under Pakistani control, was a district in Ladakh. 
           Skardo was the winter capital of Ladakh while Leh was the summer capital.
      </p>
      <p>The mountain ranges in this region were formed over 45 million years by the folding of the Indian Plate 
        into the more stationary Eurasian Plate. The drift continues, causing frequent earthquakes in the Himalayan region.
         The peaks in the Ladakh Range are at a medium altitude close to the Zoji-la (5,000–5,500 m or 16,400–18,000 ft) and
          increase toward southeast, culminating in the twin summits of Nun-Kun</p>
            <p>The Suru and Zanskar valleys form a great trough enclosed by the Himalayas and the Zanskar Range. 
              Rangdum is the highest inhabited region in the Suru valley, after which the valley rises to 4,400 m (14,400 ft) at Pensi-la,
               the gateway to Zanskar. Kargil, the only town in the Suru valley, is the second most important town in Ladakh. 
               It was an important staging post on the routes of the trade caravans before 1947, being more or less equidistant,
                at about 230 kilometres from Srinagar, Leh, Skardu and Padum. The Zangskar valley lies in the troughs of the Stod
                 and the Lungnak rivers. The region experiences heavy snowfall; the Pensi-la is open only between June and mid-October. 
                 Dras and the Mushkoh Valley form the western extremity of Ladakh.</p>
