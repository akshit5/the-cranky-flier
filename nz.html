<h2>New Zealand</h2>
<p>New Zealand is located near the centre of the water hemisphere and is made up of two main islands and a number of smaller islands.
     The two main islands (the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Māui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamu) are separated by Cook Strait, 
     22 kilometres (14 mi) wide at its narrowest point.Besides the North and South Islands,
      the five largest inhabited islands are Stewart Island (across the Foveaux Strait), Chatham Island, Great Barrier Island 
      (in the Hauraki Gulf), D'Urville Island (in the Marlborough Sounds) and Waiheke Island from central Auckland).</p>
      <p>
        New Zealand is long and narrow—over 1,600 kilometres (990 mi) along its north-north-east axis with a maximum width of 400 kilometres
         (250 mi)—with about 15,000 km (9,300 mi) of coastline and a total land area of 268,000 square kilometres (103,500 sq mi).
          Because of its far-flung outlying islands and long coastline, the country has extensive marine resources. 
         Its exclusive economic zone is one of the largest in the world, covering more than 15 times its land area.
      </p>
      <p>The South Island is the largest landmass of New Zealand. 
          It is divided along its length by the Southern Alps.
           There are 18 peaks over 3,000 metres (9,800 ft), the highest of which is Aoraki / Mount Cook at 3,724 metres (12,218 ft).
           Fiordland's steep mountains and deep fiords record the extensive ice age glaciation of this southwestern corner of the South Island.
            The North Island is less mountainous but is marked by volcanism.
            The highly active Taupo Volcanic Zone has formed a large volcanic plateau, 
            punctuated by the North Island's highest mountain, Mount Ruapehu (2,797 metres (9,177 ft)). 
            The plateau also hosts the country's largest lake, Lake Taupo,nestled in the caldera of one of the world's most active supervolcanoes.</p>
            <p>The country owes its varied topography, and perhaps even its emergence above the waves,
                 to the dynamic boundary it straddles between the Pacific and Indo-Australian Plates.
                  New Zealand is part of Zealandia, a microcontinent nearly half the size of Australia that gradually submerged
                   after breaking away from the Gondwanan supercontinent.
                    About 25 million years ago, a shift in plate tectonic movements began to contort and crumple the region.
                     This is now most evident in the Southern Alps, formed by compression of the crust beside the Alpine Fault.
                      Elsewhere the plate boundary involves the subduction of one plate under the other, producing the Puysegur Trench to the south,
                       the Hikurangi Trench east of the North Island, and the Kermadec and Tonga Trenchesfurther north.</p>
