<h2>My Life's A Movie</h2>
<p>Keirsten is a California native who quit a career in finance to travel the world. She’s been traveling for 5 years and is ‘killing it’. 
    This girl has some amazing girl power! Keirsten is also a good writer, content creator, and extremely talented in photography. 
    Travel is the best kind of education so go get lost, even if it’s just outside your own doorstep!<br>
    I created this life of full-time traveling completely on my own, and my goal is to give you as much information and inspiration as possible to make travel
     happen for you too!

    If you have a question about a post, please leave me a comment or on my Instagram – @mylifesatravelmovie</p>
     
      <h3>7 Day Samoa Island Itinerary</h3>
      <p>Samoa has been on my bucketlist for quite some time now, and I’m beyond fulfilled after finally traveling there! Chances are
           if you’re reading this you already know where it is and what’s mostly there, but for generality, I’ll start from the top! For starters, 
           there are two “Samoa’s” and they’re separated by the International Date Line; one that’s it’s own...</p>
            <h3>30 Most Epic Adventures Before 30 – My Bucketlist</h3>
            <p>
                I have a bit of an obsession with chasing after and checking off my bucketlist items…so much
                 so that I recently decided to get my greatest bucketlist checks tattooed on my forearm!
                  It’s probably the most meaningful thing I’ve ever done for myself other than sending “Future Alyssa” postcards from
                   Antarctica and Kilimanjaro saying how...
                </p>


     <h3>Tips for Climbing Kilimanjaro</h3>
     <p>Everyone will tell you some statistic about the hike to Kilimanjaro being something% physical and somethingmore% mental. 
         Usually I have no clue what people are talking about when they say that, but thinking back on my trek, I know I always was super excited and positive,
          and never once doubted getting up to the summit!<br>

        If you start to have a negative or doubtful thought about ANYTHING….STOP yourself, erase it, and
         think about unicorns flying high over the majestic clouds of the Kilimanjaro summit that you’re about to see.
          Or keep reminding yourself that this is going to be the most epic work out of your life, and  you’re going to look bomb AF afterwards! </p>
             <h3>Must-Do Things in the Maldives!</h3>
             <p>Crystal clear water rolling up onto white sandy beaches is just a fraction of the things you can look forward to experiencing
                  in the Maldives! While it’s 100% fine to spend most of your days lounging under palm trees, 
                  in the two weeks that I spent on these spectacular islands, I came up with quite the list of must-do things in the Maldives!</p>
            
                <p>There are two ways to get around all of the (hundreds of) islands in the Maldives: by boat or by plane.
                     Trust me when I say that at least once, you need to take a plane, if just for the view! From above is the only true way
                      to see just how beautiful these specs of Earth are, and how gorgeous the waters are that surround them. 
                      If you look closely, you can even spot the over-water bungalows! </p>
