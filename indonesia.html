<h2>Indonesia</h2>
<p>Indonesia is an ethnically diverse country, with around 300 distinct native ethnic groups.
     Most Indonesians are descended from Austronesian peoples whose languages had origins in Proto-Austronesian,
      which possibly originated in what is now Taiwan. Another major grouping is the Melanesians, who inhabit eastern Indonesia 
      (the Maluku Islands and Western New Guinea).</p>
      <p>
        The Javanese are the largest ethnic group, constituting 40.2% of the population,
         and are politically dominant.
         They are predominantly located in the central to eastern parts of Java and also sizable numbers in most provinces. 
         The Sundanese, Malay, Batak, Madurese, Minangkabau and Buginese are the next largest groups in the country.
          A sense of Indonesian nationhood exists alongside strong regional identities.
      </p>
      <p>The country's official language is Indonesian, a variant of Malay based on its prestige dialect, 
          which for centuries had been the lingua franca of the archipelago. It was promoted by nationalists
           in the 1920s and achieved official status under the name Bahasa Indonesia in 1945.
           As a result of centuries-long contact with other languages, it is rich in local and foreign influences, 
           including from Javanese, Sundanese, Minangkabau, Hindi, Sanskrit, Chinese, Arabic, Dutch, Portuguese and English.
            Nearly every Indonesian speaks the language due to its widespread use in education, academics, communications, business, politics, and mass media.
             Most Indonesians also speak at least one of more than 700 local languages,
              often as their first language. Most belong to the Austronesian language family, while there are over 270 Papuan languages spoken in eastern Indonesia.
               Of these, Javanese is the most widely spoken</p>
            <p>In 1930, Dutch and other Europeans (Totok), Eurasians, and derivative people like the Indos, numbered 240,000 or 0.4% of the total population.
                 Historically, they constituted only a tiny fraction of the native population and continue to do so today.
                  Despite the Dutch presence for almost 350 years, the Dutch language never had a substantial number of speakers or official status.
                  The small minorities that can speak it or Dutch-based creole languages fluently are the
                   aforementioned ethnic groups and descendants of Dutch colonisers. 
                   Today, there is some degree of fluency by either educated members of the oldest generation or legal professionals,
                    as specific law codes are still only available in Dutch.</p>
