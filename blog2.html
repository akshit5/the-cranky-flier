<h2>Dan Flying Solo</h2>
<p>Hey, I’m Dan! Obsessed with exploring the world, meeting new people (+ goats)
     and getting as lost as possible with my camera. I was on the road for 1467 days between 2014 – 2018, 
     taking a chance on changing my career from restaurants to capturing the world and somehow it all worked out…
    <br><br>I hope this site gives you some inspiration (and handy tips) to go and chase your own adventures. 
    Travel is the best kind of education so go get lost, even if it’s just outside your own doorstep!</p>
     
      <h3>Winter in Bulgaria</h3>
      <p>Starting to plan ahead for a winter trip when the world hopefully returns to normal? Look no further than Bulgaria!

        From learning to Ski in Bansko, one of the most affordable ski destinations in Europe, to exploring snow capped mountains hiding UNECO monasteries,
         Bulgaria offers the perfect value winter escape, rounded off with the ancient history of culture of Plovdiv and Sofia.</p>
            <h3>Surprising Singapore</h3>
            <p>
                Singapore has developed a (well deserved) reputation as a stopover destination. 
                With Changi, the best airport in the world, and Singapore Airlines, my favourite to fly, 
                it’s not hard to guess why. How many other airports in the world can you catch a free movie, enjoy a butterfly or sunflower garden,
                 relax by a waterfall, shop till you drop, or even check-in to an airport rooftop pool?
                </p>

<p>Then, of course, if you have scheduled your flights to have a layover of more than a few hours, 
    the excellent public transport or extensive line of taxis make it super easy to nip into the city. 
    Soak up the famous sights like the Marina and Gardens by the Bay, before enjoying a Singapore Sling and 
    some Chilli Crab at the airport before your onward journey.</p>
     <h3>Reasons to visit Sado Island, Japan</h3>
     <p>Japan is a nation of clashes and contradictions, from the modern, or in-fact, futuristic cities,
          to the traditional elements that blend so naturally amongst the skyscrapers and robot restaurants. 
          But if you want to soak up the atmosphere of Japan from years gone by, Sado Island provides the perfect opportunity. </p>
         <p>The Taiko Experience Exchange Center usually closes in the winter months, but luckily as it was their last days of packing everything away,
              they had agreed to squeeze me in for a little lesson.<br>

            Taiko itself means a percussion instrument, but Sado Island is famed for its players, 
            the Kodo Group, who tour the world showing off their skills and I was lucky to have one of these stars teaching me the ropes during a one-hour lesson.
             The huge wooden hall had drums of all size in them, including two giant ones that my instructor had helped hand carve from a single hollowed-out 
             tree herself. </p>
             <h3>Best Places to Visit in Europe this Autumn & Winter</h3>
             <p>The offseason is the best time to visit Europe and pretend it is your own private playground.
                  Whilst the famous cities of London and Paris never really lose the crowds, here are a few trade-offs 
                  I am sure you will fall in love that are (nearly) free from selfie stick attacks and queues long enough 
                  to be a flight time during the offseason.</p>
            
                <p>Exploring Europe is super easy thanks to both how close countries are, and also the Schengen zone making bus travel between
                     cities sometimes the best routes at the most affordable prices. To hunt for timetables make use of the Omio app and website
                      (formerly GoEuro) which allows you to search and book trains, buses and flights in Europe and is a great tool to help you plan,
                       especially given there can be many different bus operators on each route. </p>
