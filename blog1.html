<h2>Backpacking Essentials</h2>
<p>In this article, we’ll be going through what to pack for Europe, 
    including what kinds of clothes should be on your backpacking Europe packing list,
     as well as some of the essential electronics and gadgets to make your trip all the easier!</p>
      <p>
        The weather in Europe is generally quite mild but can be very changeable. 
        To keep up with the weather and be prepared for whatever is thrown at you, 
        it’s best to pack a range of basic and versatile clothing items that can be layered if need be.
      </p>
      <h3>Clothing to Pack for Europe</h3>
      <h4>Tops</h4>
      <p>T-shirts and tank tops are a must when traveling to Europe, regardless of where you’re going.
           On hot days, you’ll be thankful that your skin can breathe freely, while on cooler days, you’ll be happy to have that extra layer underneath.
            You’ll also want to bring at least one long-sleeved top that can be dressed up or down, as well as a versatile sweater.</p>
            <h4>Bottoms</h4>
            <p>
                Ideally, choose your most comfortable pair of jeans that can be dressed up or down and 
                that you would be happy wearing while walking around the city. If you’re planning on being very physically active on your trip,
                 such as going on lots of hikes, you might also want to consider bringing a pair of hiking pants or jogging bottoms. Something comfy!
                </p>

<p>Another essential is leggings. Not only can they be used for a range of activities from hiking to casual tourism,
     but they can also be layered under jeans when in colder climates (the same goes for thermals!).</p>
     <h4>Outerwear</h4>
     <p>Remember that Europe is, by and large, rainy! Preferably, 
         find a compact rain jacket that can be folded up into a little bag that can then be clipped to your backpack. </p>
         <p>For an extra layer during the colder months, be sure to bring a fleece-lined jacket as well. Fleece is a
             great option for that extra layer as it provides a lot of warmth without being too bulky or heavy. </p>
             <h4>Shoes</h4>
             <p>At the very least, you should bring a pair of trainers or other style of comfortable casual shoes, 
                something that you would be happy to spend hours walking around in. For many trips, a comfortable casual shoe should be enough,
                 but it would be worthwhile also bringing a light pair of nice flats if you’re planning on going to any upscale restaurants. 
                And don’t forget to bring flip flops, which are perfect for the beach as well as those questionable hostel showers!</p>
                <h4>Electronics Devices</h4>
                <p>Regardless of where you’re traveling from, a universal adapter is probably going to be essential. 
                    Most countries in Europe use a standard two-prong plug, and the UK uses its own three-prong plug. 
                    If you’re traveling from the states and bringing along electronics that operate on 110 volts, you’ll need to bring a voltage converter as well. </p>
